have reasons for my hypothesis:
famous example

VIM vs. neoVIM fork
what year. 
details from news
flame-ups ... social media flame ups -> bad breakups

re-integration: aweful
stealing developers
	Google vs. Dropbox: Python creator

to merge projects
	e.g. Apache CouchDB ---fork--> BigCouch. in 2010. However, BigCouch merged back to CouchDB on Jul 25, 2013.

anecdotal evidence -> early in paper
mid-paper -> what to measure

paper on break-up (flame-up, projects swallow)

reason for hypotheses

data sources -> pasts contains flames

be specific, 
	especially for remedy.

CUSUM 

Why? A single observation of a network measure that is slightly higher than normal may not indicate a change in the network; however multiple observations that are slightly higher than normal may indicate a shift in the mean of the measure.

Heterophily, 
or love of the different, is the tendency of individuals to collect in diverse groups; it is the opposite of homophily. This phenomenon is notable in successful organizations, where the resulting diversity of ideas is thought to promote an innovative environment. Recently it has become an area of social network analysis.
------------------------------------------------
Heterophily Theory
more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties."

cognitive demand -> predictive of emergent leader, in multi-modal network

removal of a node, (which node? in hierarchical organizational structure, rather than a flat structure): 

result in infighting
because
there's no clear contender to the in-charge

Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperation
Martin A. Nowak

1) Kin Selection: 
	Hamilton's rule states that the coefficient of relatedness, r, must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act: Formula(1)
	Relatedness is defined as the probability of sharing a gene. The probability that two brothers share the same gene by descent is 1/2; the same probability for cousins is 1/8. 

2) Direct Reciprocity
3) Indirect Reciprocity
4) Network Reciprocity
5) Group Selection
