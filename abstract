Social networks are a ubiquitous part of our social lives, and the creation of online social communities has been a natural extension of this phenomena. Free and Open Source Software Development efforts are prime examples of how communities can be leverages in software development, where group are formed around communities of interest, and depend on continued interest and involvement. Forking, either as a violent split or a friendly divide, affects the community. Most research on forking is post-hoc. The run-up to fork is seldom looked at. This leaves a number of questions unanswered. In this study, we propose to use temporal social network analysis to study the evolution and social dynamics of FOSS communities. With these techniques we aim to identify better measures for influence and the shift of influence, measures associated with unhealthy group dynamics, e.g. a simmering conflict, as well as early indicators of major events in the lifespan of a community. One set of dynamics we are especially interested in, are those that lead FOSS projects to fork. This will help predict formation of unhealthy dynamics, which gives the community a heads-up when they can still take action to ensure the sustainability of the project.
