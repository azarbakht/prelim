Original: Nethack (http://www.nethack.org/)
Forked: Slash'EM (http://www.slashem.org/)
Date: 1996 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2089235)
Reason: More community-driven development (New releases too slow)
Outcome: Both exist and evolve
Type: Game
Other: 

Article about Slash'EM. There it says that it is Nethack variant, not a fork. It is a fork of a software called Slash together with another patch for the game called the Wizard Patch. 
http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/06/12/slashem.html

Nethack uses the Nethack General Public License (http://www.nethack.org/common/license.html) a copyleft license based on Bison's license (and authored by rms)

According to its Wikipedia page Slash'EM uses a dual license: Nethack GPL and MIT, although I haven't seen in the sources any reference to the MIT license.

In the main web site of Slash'EM, you can find the reasons for the fork:
"""
But the DevTeam, the reclusive masterminds of Nethack, are a rather quiet bunch, gracing the world with new versions as they see fit, and when they see fit. Which is usually a new version every good number of years.

And there was much gnashing of teeth.

But because of the Freely Available Source Code Phenomenon, people began making their own versions of Nethack to tide themselves between magical releases.

SLASH'EM is the (continuing) saga of one such variant...

From the slamfaq.txt file in the sources of Slash'Em:
"""
At its very heart and core, it's still good ol' vanilla Nethack,
by the illustrious DevTeam (http://www.nethack.org/).

The code base from which this was started is SuperLotsaAddedStuffHack
(SLASH) 4.1.2E8, ported by Enrico Horn.  He took the old SLASH V6 (a
variant for Nethack 3.1.3) code by Tom Proudfoot, and ported it to use
the Nethack 3.2.2 code.  SLASH was probably the most popular variant
of Nethack.

On top of this is added the Wizard Patch 0.7 by Larry Stewart-Zerba
and Warwick Allison (also known for the Qt Nethack port).

In 1999, developers wanting a free software version to be available went back to the older 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license. Björn Grönvall's OSSH was subsequently developed from this codebase. Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Grönvall's code and did extensive work on it, creating OpenSSH, which shipped with the 2.6 release of OpenBSD. From this version, a "portability" branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems. As of 2005, OpenSSH was the single most popular SSH implementation, coming by default in a large number of operating systems. OSSH meanwhile has become obsolete.[13] OpenSSH continued to be maintained and now supports both 1.x and 2.0 versions.

Trademark issues around SSH (from the OpenSSH Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH):
"""
In February 2001, Tatu Ylönen, Chairman and CTO of SSH Communications Security informed the OpenSSH development mailing list, that after speaking with key OpenSSH developers Markus Friedl, Theo de Raadt, and Niels Provos, the company would be asserting its ownership of the "SSH" and "Secure Shell" trademarks. Ylönen commented that the trademark "is a significant asset ... SSH Communications Security has made a substantial investment in time and money in its SSH mark"[8] and sought to change references to the protocol to "SecSH" or "secsh", in order to maintain control of the "SSH" name. He proposed that OpenSSH change its name in order to avoid a lawsuit, a suggestion that developers resisted. OpenSSH developer Damien Miller replied that "SSH has been a generic term to describe the protocol well before your [Ylönen's] attempt to trademark it" and urged Ylönen to reconsider, commenting: "I think that the antipathy generated by pursuing a free software project will cost your company a lot more than a trademark."[9]
At the time, "SSH," "Secure Shell" and "ssh" had appeared in documents proposing the protocol as an open standard and it was hypothesised that by doing so, without marking these within the proposal as registered trademarks, Ylönen was relinquishing all exclusive rights to the name as a means of describing the protocol. Improper use of a trademark, or allowing others to use a trademark incorrectly, results in the trademark becoming a generic term, like Kleenex or Aspirin, which opens the mark to use by others.[10] After study of the USPTO trademark database, many online pundits opined that the term "ssh" was not trademarked, merely the logo using the lower case letters "ssh." In addition, the six years between the company's creation and the time when it began to defend its trademark, and that only OpenSSH was receiving threats of legal repercussions, weighed against the trademark's validity.[11]
Both developers of OpenSSH and Ylönen himself were members of the IETF working group developing the new standard; after several meetings this group denied Ylönen's request to rename the protocol, citing concerns that it would set a bad precedent for other trademark claims against the IETF. The participants argued that both "Secure Shell" and "SSH" were generic terms and could not be trademarks.[12]

From the NeoOffice Wikipedia Page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeoOffice):
"""
OpenOffice.org was originally released by Sun under both the LGPL and SISSL; it is now released solely under the LGPL. However, OpenOffice.org requires a copyright assignment for contributions to the main code base; this allows Sun to create proprietary versions of the software (notably StarOffice). NeoOffice chooses not to assign its code to Sun; this prevents NeoOffice code from being used in official OpenOffice.org versions. Instead, NeoOffice is released only under the GPL (this is allowed by the LGPL), which ensures that any software based on it remains free.
There were initially some attempts to resolve the licensing differences and foster more direct cooperation and code-sharing between the NeoOffice and OpenOffice.org developers. However, the NeoOffice developers have stated that they prefer to work separately from OpenOffice.org because "coordination requires a significant amount of time"; (http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/faq.php#11) on the other side, the OpenOffice.org developers state: "A proposal to work together has been made, and NeoOffice developers refused".(http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/FAQ_Openoffice.org_and_NeoOffice#Q5:_But_it_would_be_more_efficient.2C_if_there_would_be_only_one_effort...)

Type: Web (CMS)
Date: August 17 2005 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla)
Reason: More community-driven development - Concerns that Miro (Mambo's main sponsor) would take the project and relegate community
Outcome: Mambo development ceased. Last version 4.6.5; June 26, 2008
Other: 

From the Joomla Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla):
"""
Joomla! was the result of a fork of Mambo on August 17, 2005. At that time, the Mambo name was trademarked by Miro International Pvt Ltd. who formed a non-profit foundation with the stated purpose to fund the project and protect it from lawsuits (http://www.mambo-foundation.org/). The Joomla development team claimed that many of the provisions of the foundation structure went against previous agreements made by the elected Mambo Steering Committee, lacked the necessary consultation with key stake-holders and included provisions that violated core open source values (http://forum.joomla.org/index.php/topic,73.0.html).
The Joomla development team created a web site called OpenSourceMatters.org to distribute information to users, developers, web designers and the community in general. Project leader Andrew Eddie wrote a letter (http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=57645) which appeared on the announcements section of the public forum at mamboserver.com.
A little more than one thousand people had joined the OpenSourceMatters.org web site within a day, most posting words of encouragement and support, and the web site received the Slashdot effect as a result. Miro CEO Peter Lamont gave a public response to the development team in an article titled "The Mambo Open Source Controversy - 20 Questions With Miro". This event created controversy within the free software community about the definition of "open source". Forums at many other open source projects were active with postings for and against the actions of both sides.
In the two weeks following Eddie's announcement, teams were re-organized, and the community continued to grow. Eben Moglen and the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) assisted the Joomla! core team beginning in August 2005, as indicated by Moglen's blog entry from that date and a related OSM announcement(http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/blog/2005/08/index.html)(http://www.opensourcematters.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=1). The SFLC continue to provide legal guidance to the Joomla! project (http://www.joomla.org/content/view/40/41/).
On August 18, 2005, Andrew Eddie called for community input on suggested names for the project. The core team indicated that it would make the final decision for the project name based on community input. The core team eventually chose a name that was not on the list of suggested names provided by the community.

Type: Graphics
Date: November 2003 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape)
Reason: Differences among developer team
Outcome: Sodipodi got discontinued since its 0.34 version, February 11, 2004 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodipodi)
Other:

From the Inkscape Wikipedia page ():
"""
The fork was led by a team of four former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, Nathan Hurst, and MenTaLguY) who identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements as their reasons for forking. With Inkscape, they said they would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized creating a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.
Since the fork, Inkscape has changed from using the C programming language to C++; changed to the GTK+ toolkit C++ bindings (gtkmm); redesigned the user interface and added a number of new features. Its implementation of the SVG standard has shown gradual improvement, but still is incomplete (http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_SVG_features_does_Inkscape_implement.3F).
Rather than top-down governance, its developers strive to encourage an egalitarian culture where authority stems from an individual developer's abilities and active involvement in the project.

From the FAQ page at Inkscape (http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/EsFAQ#Why_the_split_from_Sodipodi.3F)
"""
Why the split from Sodipodi?

Inkscape started as a code fork of Sodipodi. The main reasons were differences in objectives and in development approach. Inkscape's objective is to be a fully compliant SVG editor, whereas for Sodipodi SVG is more a means-to-an-end of being a vector illustration tool. Inkscape's development approach emphasizes open developer access to the codebase, as well as using and contributing back to 3rd party libraries and standards such as HIG, CSS, etc. in preference to custom solutions. Reusing existing shared solutions helps developer to focus on the core work of Inkscape.

For background, it may also be worth reviewing Lauris' Sodipodi direction post from Oct 2003, and his thoughts on SVG, licensing, and the value of splitting the project into two independent branches.

From the Xvid Wikipedia page ():
"""
In January 2001, DivXNetworks founded OpenDivX as part of Project Mayo which was intended to be a home for open source multimedia projects. OpenDivX was an open-source MPEG-4 video codec based on a stripped down version of the MoMuSys reference MPEG-4 encoder. The source code, however, was placed under a restrictive license and only members of the DivX Advanced Research Centre (DARC) had write access to the project CVS. In early 2001, DARC member Sparky wrote an improved version of the encoding core called encore2. This was updated several times before, in April, it was removed from CVS without warning. The explanation given by Sparky was "We (our bosses) decided that we are not ready to have it in public yet." (http://linuxfr.org/2004/06/11/16509.html)

In July 2001, developers started complaining about a lack of activity in the project; the last CVS commit was several months before, bugfixes were being ignored, and promised documentation had not been written. Soon after, DARC released a beta version of their closed-source commercial DivX 4 codec, which was based on encore2, saying that "what the community really wants is a Winamp, not a Linux." (http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/vorbis/2001-August/004220.html) It was after this that a fork of OpenDivX was created, using the latest version of encore2 that was downloaded before it was removed. Since then, all the OpenDivX code has been replaced and Xvid has been published under the GNU General Public License.

In 1997, a group of developers formed EGCS (Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System) (http://home.schmorp.de/pgcc-faq.html#egcs), to merge several experimental forks into a single project.

(http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/History and http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Stallman/history_of_gcc_development.shtml)

EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, "blessed" EGCS as the official version of GCC and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999. Furthermore, the project explicitly adopted the "bazaar" model over the "cathedral" model. With the release of GCC 2.95 in July 1999, the two projects were once again united.
GCC is now maintained by a varied group of programmers from around the world, under the direction of a steering committee (http://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html). It has been ported to more kinds of processors and operating systems than any other compiler (http://www.linfo.org/gcc.html).

To stay alive, LimeWire decided to throw in the towel and began work on a DRM client.

LimeWire's DRM client, although not yet operational, is designed to block unlicensed material from infiltrating the Gnutella network. If the client is released, it will equate to millions of individuals who will find themselves adrift on a network without resources. Unless they've already made the switch to FrostWire.

FrostWire is fork of the LimeWire project. Unlike other closed source clients whose years of hard work will go for naught, LimeWire intelligently designed an open source client. This allowed a community of developers over the years to participate in the evolution of this client. The development team of FrostWire was part of this community.

Even if LimeWire either ceases operations or releases thier DRM client, the core product will continue to live on. Considering the amount of attention and press given to FrostWire so far, it's possible this client may become the popular successor to the Gnutella crown.

Why did you fork beep-media-player?
First off, the fork has no political reasons, it is based entirely on the following issues:
* BMP classic had a number of deficiencies relating to Unicode.
* BMP classic is no longer actively maintained by the development team.
* We had our own ideas about how a player should be designed, which we wanted to try in a production environment.
Beep lacked functionality that is useful for people who do streaming, such as the songchange plugin from XMMS.
Therefore, a fork seemed most logical as a choice for accomplishing our goals. The BMP team has done very good work, but their ideas for a next-generation beep do not align with ours.

So, why not work with XMMS2?
Working with XMMS2 does not seem like the best choice for us because we are not interested in developing a media client. We're looking to develop a media player based on our concepts of design, functionality and usability.
We may work with XMMS2 on codec support at some point in the future.

BMPx is a nice media player for what it is -- a jukebox. We're not too interested in having a jukebox, though.

10/17/01
Eric Caldwell, 17 October 2001

With all the different CMS's out there, why was MyPHPNuke developed?

To start, lets look at what's out there as far as the different phpNuke forks which will help you better understand why MyPHPNuke (MPN) was developed. 

If you want to think of an original Nuke distro then we need look no further than phpNuke (http://www.phpnuke.org). phpNuke was a GPL project started by Francisco Burzi out of frustration because of the dearth of quality CMS's (content management systems). 

In short, Francisco Burzi (the original author of phpNuke) was in search of a nice CMS and soon found that other CMS's were incomplete and not very flexible. Due to this frustration, the phpNuke project was born to in hopes of delivering an easy to use, easy to install and easy to maintain CMS that didn't have enormous systems requirements. All that's needed to run phpNuke is Apache, MySQL and PHP. These simple systems requirements is one of the distinctions that make phpNuke a hit. It has low systems requirements and was written in a server side scripting language (PHP) that's easy to learn, cross platform and is building critical developer mass.

Now we get to the meat of why MPN was born; phpNuke was (and still is) considered buggy, unstable for production use and not feature complete. During the development of phpNuke, a project called NukeAddons (http://www.nukeaddons.com) was created with the mission of taking existing PHP scripts and porting them to work within the phpNuke framework to fill out some missing feature gaps. 

The problem with this approach was that phpNuke was in heavy development as was the NukeAddons scripts (which was almost always a release behind), When you put them together (phpNuke and NukeAddon modules), life became a chore since site developers were continually chasing bugs.

This development process was frustrating many in the Nuke community and one day a guy by the name of Kodewulf decided that he'd had enough and started what is now MyPHPNuke. With a fork in hand (pardon the pun), Kodewulf's first decision was to take the phpNuke 4.4x base and the NukeAddon modules and combine them into a stable feature rich Nuke distro. Through the hard work of Kodewulf, a few other developers, Ruffdogs.com and myPHPNuke.com, you have what you have today, a stable base system that you can dependably run a production web site on.

To sum it up, MPN should be looked at as a mature core system that's easy to install and relatively bug free.

The developer, who has been working on the product since at least 1998, said commercial pressures facing Tenable Network Security, the company he started in 2002 around Nessus, was forcing him to stop making the software's source code available.

Outcome: Remerged January 1997.

Other: 

More in "History of glibc and Linux libc" at http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=85

From the glibc Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library):
"""
In the early 1990s, the developers of the Linux kernel forked glibc. Their fork, called "Linux libc", was maintained separately for years and released versions 2 through 5.

When FSF released glibc 2.0 in January 1997, it had much more complete POSIX standards support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future version compatibility support, and the code was more portable (http://web.archive.org/web/20040411191201/http://people.redhat.com/~sopwith/old/glibc-vs-libc5.html). At this point, the Linux kernel developers discontinued their fork and returned to using FSF's glibc (http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/3874).

The last used version of Linux libc used the internal name (soname) libc.so.5. Following on from this, glibc 2.x on Linux uses the soname libc.so.6 (http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/forking.html) (Alpha and IA64 architectures now use libc.so.6.1, instead). The soname is often abbreviated as libc6 (for example in the package name in Debian) following the normal conventions for libraries.

According to Richard Stallman, the changes that had been made in Linux libc could not be merged back into glibc because the authorship status of that code was unclear and the GNU project is quite strict about recording copyright and authors (http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/forking.html#foot25).

Ashton-Tate divested its interest and Microsoft became the lead partner after porting SQL Server to Windows NT.

At the time, Sybase called the database server "Sybase SQL Server" and made a deal with Microsoft to share the source code for Microsoft to remarket on the OS/2 platform as "SQL Server". Until version 4.9, Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server were virtually identical. Due to disagreements between the two companies over revenue sharing (or lack thereof), Sybase and Microsoft decided to split the code-lines and went their own way, although the shared heritage is very evident in the Transact-SQL (T-SQL) procedural language as well as the basic process architecture. The big difference is that Sybase has a Unix heritage, while Microsoft SQL Server was adapted and optimized only for the Microsoft Windows NT operating system (vendor lock-in). Sybase continues to offer versions for Windows, several varieties of Unix, and for Linux.

Reason: Experimental - Developers failed to come to an agreement on a development transition path which allowed the research version of Samba he was developing (known at the time as Samba-NTDOM) to slowly be integrated into Samba (http://us1.samba.org/samba/tng.html)

Other: 

From the Samba-TNG wiki (http://wiki.samba-tng.org/doku.php/pages/faq#what_is_the_relationship_between_samba_and_samba-tng):
"""
Samba is a large, well-established project with a great deal of corporate interest and involvement. As such, they have to be very careful when making large changes to their code. This has led to the attitude that the code repository should be kept pretty much in working condition at all times, making it difficult to implement experimental changes and improvements.

The Samba-TNG project started in late 1999 as a separate CVS branch of the Samba code, specifically to allow some of the more experimental code ideas to be fleshed out and tested without affecting the stability of Samba as a whole. Specifically, developer Luke Leighton had many new ideas about the design of the domain controller code, some of which were considered either too risky or too controversial for the main development codebase. Thus, the Samba-TNG branch was initially his playground for trying out these ideas.

In October 2000 the project was moved to its own servers, mailing lists, etc. and the world heard about the “Samba fork”, which by then was actually old news.

While there is rivalry between the two projects, it is not hostile. On the contrary, code is frequently synchronized between the two projects in areas where we agree. We also routinely refer prospective users to Samba in cases where it would better fit the user's needs.

See this message from Andrew Tridgell for the “other side” of this story: http://us1.samba.org/samba/tng.html

"""
How does GraphicsMagick differ from ImageMagick?
GraphicsMagick is originally based on (forked from) ImageMagick 5.5.2 in November 2002, from the version distributed by ImageMagick Studio LLC, which is itself forked in August 1999 from ImageMagick developed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company starting in 1992. 
[...]

How often does GraphicsMagick pick up new code from ImageMagick?
GraphicsMagick never picks up new code from ImageMagick as distributed by ImageMagick Studio LLC. Not long after the GraphicsMagick project was started in November 2002, ImageMagick from ImageMagick Studio LLC abandoned the MIT X11 style license it had been using since 1992, and switched between several different licenses until it ended up with one based on the Apache license, which is intended to penalize projects which borrow some of its source code, or fork from it. Since that time, GraphicsMagick has not incorporated any ImageMagick source code.

On November 27, 2003 ImageMagick Studio LLC applied to register "ImageMagick" as its trademark, and it was awarded this registered trademark (serial number 78333969) on August 30, 2005. Those who re-distribute modified versions of "ImageMagick" (e.g. patched or improved) under license as "ImageMagick" now face the risk of arbitrary trademark infringement claims by ImageMagick Studio LLC.

Authors of new features are encouraged to independently contribute their work to the GraphicsMagick project so that it can be released under GraphicsMagick's MIT X11 style license without additional encumberment. In order for a work to be accepted, it must have been developed entirely outside the ImageMagick source base to avoid any possibility of copyright taint.

From (http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/008276.html):
"""
In case you ran across this report that the "Mozilla Suite aka Mozilla Application Suite aka Mozilla 1.x is changing name to SeaMonkey" I wanted to point out that it's inaccurate in several ways.

First, the Mozilla Suite, aka Mozilla Application Suite, aka Mozilla 1.x is _not_ being renamed. It will never be renamed. Those names will continue to describe the suite of applications maintained by the Mozilla Foundation on the Mozilla 1.7 branch. The latest release of this product is Mozilla 1.7.8 and is available from here. Maintenance releases will continue from this branch so expect to see a Mozilla 1.7.9, Mozilla 1.7.10, Mozilla 1.7.11, etc.

Second, there is a new project, organized by a new community group, to build and release a new suite (similar to the official Mozilla Application Suite which is now officially in maintenances mode). This new project will necessarily have a new name. That name is being worked on now and the current hope is to secure the name "Seamonkey" for this new project.

To repeat, The Mozilla Application Suite is in maintenances mode on the 1.7 branch and will retain it's name(s) for as long as we continue to support it (years.) There is a new project with the goal of building a new application suite from the trunk. This project is not Mozilla 1.x (the Mozilla Application Suite, or the Mozilla Suite). This project is searching for a new name and hopes to secure the name "Seamonkey".

If and when this new project does do a release, it will probably be called Seamonkey 1.0. It will not be the Mozilla Foundation supported upgrade path for Mozilla 1.x users. Those users are encouraged to migrate to Firefox and Thunderbird or continue to use the security maintenances releases of Mozilla 1.x. Again, this is a new project and it will necessarily have a new name. It is not the renaming of an old project.

As of June 2010, there are two versions of RPM in development – one led by the Fedora Project and Red Hat, and the other by a separate group led by a previous maintainer of RPM, a former employee of Red Hat.

RPM.org

The rpm.org community's first major code revision was in July 2007; version 4.8 was released in January 2010, and 4.9 in March 2011.

This version is used by distributions such as Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell's openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise, CentOS and formerly Mandriva (only for 2009.0 - 2010.2).

RPM v5

However, in the view of some of Redmine's leading developers, the maintenance and evolution of Redmine has not been as predictable and responsive as its developer community is capable of. Integration of community-created patches were too sporadic, lacked a clear methodology, and was interfering with the effectiveness of the Redmine project for its users. Over the past two years, several members of Redmine's community worked to resolve management bottlenecks through clear suggestions and contributions. They also attempted to broaden and open up the development process to more contributors. But efforts via public and private forums to discuss the goals and future direction with the project manager of Redmine failed, as the current project manager did not share these priorities.

A group of developers from the Redmine community has therefore concluded that the only way to ensure continued, sustained and stable development of our favorite project management solution is to fork it. We, long-standing community members and contributors, pledge to uphold the ideals of Free and Open Source Software ethics, governance and development practices in order to produce a reliable project management system released under the name of ChiliProject in February 2011.

So, why forking?

The goal behind Tryton is not to create a direct competitor but to provide a new way to tackle the problem of programming a business software. The idea is to favor a solid and consistent solution over more cutting edge features.

Practically this means that today (20 October 2008), compared to the version of Tiny ERP (4.2) that was the base of the fork:

* More than 4000 lines of code have been removed and
* more than 11000 lines of code have been added.

Moreover, all the modules available in Tryton have been completely rewritten, which represent nearly 20000 lines of code. All this work was necessary from our point of view because most of the fundamental modules in Tiny ERP where written when some of the most advanced technical features were still missing. The result is a better harmonization between base modules, an optimized modularity and amore powerful platform for custom developments.
Here is list of improvements made on Tryton compared to OpenERP.

What prompted the split from Nexuiz?

Lee Vermeulen, the Nexuiz project founder, decided to license the Nexuiz code (with LordHavoc licensing the Darkplaces engine) to a new game development company named Illfonic so that they could develop a closed-source version for the PS3. As part of this deal, IllFonic acquired the rights to use the name Nexuiz along with the domain nexuiz.com, and are under no obligation to contribute code back to the open-source Nexuiz project (and have stated that they have no intention of doing so).

When this was announced, the response from the Nexuiz community was overwhelming negative, even among the development team and main contributors. Vermeulen had not actively participated in the project for several years and all development had been done by the community. Most members have expressed a sense of betrayal and cited the project as an example of mushroom management. Vermeulen essentially cashed in on the hard work of others and sold the code, name and reputation that they had built up over years without him.

Despite attempts to reason with IllFonic, they have refused to change the name of their project to a derivative name even though they have directly stated that their “version” of Nexuiz is a completely different game. The hijacking of the Nexuiz project by its absentee founder and IllFonic made it clear that it had no future as it stood and thus the community left to found Xonotic.

So Why Not GIMP?

We get this question a lot. Because CinePaint handles 8-bit images in common image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and PNG, that makes CinePaint an alternative to ordinary image editing tools. However, CinePaint has fundamentally different design goals from projects like GIMP. We have the interest, expertise, experience, professionalism, and pro users needed when developing successful software for the high-end.

Ever since CinePaint launched as a public project on SourceForge on July 4th, 2002, there's been quite a bit of hostility towards us from GIMP hackers. There seems to be a misconception that we're competitors. In our primary market, the film industry, our position is #2 and Adobe Photoshop is #1. GIMP is practically useless for filmmaking since it can't handle CIN, DPX or EXR files.

GIMP has pursued an architectural overhaul called GEGL that's a very different design from Glasgow. They've been at it since 2000. Glasgow began in 2004.

From 2006 to summer 2008, little development was done on the source code. Without an active source code repository and bug-tracking website, and without motivated coders, nothing happened. Then, in summer 2008, a subversion repository was set up and development began. In addition to this version, managed by HoverRace.com, another member of the HoverRace community started HoverRace Plus, intending to fork the original HoverRace source code. HoverRace Plus is now defunct, as a new fork called OpenHover has similar goals, and made an alpha release on December 14, 2008. OpenHover is a fork of HoverRace.com's HoverRace 1.23, with some changes such as chat sounds, various bug fixes, and the distinction between non-registered users, and registered monitors.

Bennugd.org: When did you decide to take charge of Fenix? Why fork it?
SplinterGU: In the year 2006, I wanted to create a game and looking for some game engine, I decided to visit the Fenix community again and found that it had been abandoned and its latest version was completely unstable and nobody used it because of how many bugs it had. I couldn't imagine how unstable it was, if I had, we wouldn't be taking this interview. At that time I decided to take charge of the project & resucitate the project.

Around the year 2008 disagreement arose with some Fenix users that couldn't keep up with the update rhythm I followed and were most of the time nagging, trying to take me out of the project (and from the forum administrative roles) and complaining about every improvement I did to the language, saying such things as that the language belonged to the community and that I had no right to change it. It was then that I decided to change the name to the Fenix version that was under development (0.93) to "Bennu Game Development" and thus I wouldn't have to explain to anybody the improvements and corrections I did -and do- to the language. That's how the fork happened.

When we started the development of SciPlore MindMapping about a year ago we decided to use FreeMind as code base. That means we used FreeMind`s source code, modified it slightly, and added some new features. It was a straight forward decision: for many years, FreeMind was bascially the standard choice if you wanted a free open source mind mapping software and it was written in Java, our preferred programing language. However, time is changing and FreeMind unfortunately is not. Since a long time, the FreeMind team is releasing new versions very slowly, not to say the development of FreeMind almost pauses.

Therefore we decided to switch to Freeplane as code base in near future (around July 2011). Freeplane was founded by Dimitry Polivaev, one of the core developers of FreeMind. Under his lead  Freeplane became a really, really nice mind mapping software over the last years. We also got many emails from our users who prefer Freeplane over FreeMind and we are sure that this is a huge improvement for all SciPlore MindMapping users.

Then we come to 14th July 2006. Apart from the French celebrating Bastille Day, this was notable for Linux-NTFS project member Szabolcs Szakacsits, (whom I shall refer to as SS from now on!), suddenly announcing the availability of ntfs-3g. This was a fork of ntfsmount, which gave it greater capability. In particular the 7 file in a folder creation limit was removed. SS made his announcement 2 days before he was off on an adventure trek for a month! My initial thought was to be deeply suspicious. What a wonderful way to introduce some malware to the community. Apparently give them something they desperately need and disappear for a month!

In the two day period before SS left for his trip there were a number of exchanges between himself and Anton Altaparmakov, (AA), maintainer of the Linux-NTFS project.. It was clear that AA had done some review of the code SS had generated. This gave me some confidence that it was not a malware threat. As I read the exchange it was clear there were differences in opinion as to how ntfs-3g should develop if it were to be integrated into the Linux-NTFS project. I must admit that SS had a much more rigid definition than AA of what he considered was tested code and I liked the definition of SS! SS was aware of some things that still needed to be done but wanted to release the code before he left on his trip - to enable more testing to occur. ntfs-3g is regarded as beta code.

Forking controversy

The project began when Chris Travers, dissatisfied with the handling of security bugs in SQL-Ledger, partnered with Christopher Murtagh to produce a fix for CVE-2006-4244.[2] This bug was apparently reported to the SQL-Ledger author, Dieter Simader, several months prior[3] to the Chrises working on a patch. The initial release of LedgerSMB has SQL-Ledger 2.6.16 with the fix for CVE-2006-4244 as its base. This release, along with full disclosure of the bug on the main mailing list,[4] strained relations between SQL-Ledger supporters and the members of the nascent LedgerSMB project.

The forking of LedgerSMB is considered by some[5] to be part of the reason for the anti-forking clause[6] in the short-lived SQL-Ledger Open Source License, the licence that was used for SQL-Ledger 2.8.0.
